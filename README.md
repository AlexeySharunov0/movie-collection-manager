# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Collection Manager

Movie Collection Manager is a Python console application designed to efficiently manage a movie collection for a cinema. This project is implemented strictly according to the provided specifications and showcases advanced Python programming skills, including object-oriented design, custom iterators, in-memory data storage using dictionaries, full type annotations, custom exception handling, and comprehensive unit testing with `pytest`.

## Features

- **Add movies:** Add new movie objects to the collection with relevant metadata such as title, director, year, genre, and duration.
- **Remove movies:** Delete movies from the collection by title.
- **Manage collection entries:** Add or remove movies within the collection dynamically.
- **Search movies:** Query the collection by multiple criteria including title, director, genre, year, and duration.
- **Iterate movies:** Traverse the movie collection using a custom iterator implemented from scratch.
- **In-memory storage:** All data is kept in application memory without any persistent storage like databases or files, strictly following assignment requirements.

## Architecture and Implementation Details

- **Object-Oriented Design:**  
  Each movie is represented by a `Movie` class instance, encapsulating all movie-related information and validation logic. The `MovieCollection` class manages all movies internally, using a Python dictionary where keys are movie titles and values are `Movie` objects. This allows O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, additions, and removals by title.

- **Custom Iterator:**  
  The `MovieCollection` class implements its own iterator protocol, allowing users to iterate over movies in a natural and Pythonic way (e.g., in a for-loop). This iterator handles internal state cleanly and respects the collectionâ€™s current state.

- **Type Annotations:**  
  All functions, methods, parameters, and return types in the project are fully annotated using Pythonâ€™s type hints (PEP 484). This improves code readability, assists static analysis tools, and demonstrates adherence to modern Python best practices.

- **Exception Handling:**  
  Two custom exception classesâ€”`DuplicateMovieError` and `MovieNotFoundError`â€”are defined and used consistently to signal error conditions such as attempting to add a movie that already exists or trying to remove/find a movie that is not in the collection. This approach makes the code robust and the errors explicit and easy to handle.

- **Testing:**  
  The entire functionality is covered by unit tests written with `pytest`. Tests verify successful additions, removals, searching, iteration behavior, and proper raising of custom exceptions on edge cases. Running tests is straightforward and ensures code reliability and future maintainability.

## Usage and Testing

To run the tests, first install dependencies (only `pytest` is required):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
